# Callouts
Blockquote callouts are really nice for drawing attention to important information. Callouts are automatically generated whenever you start a blockquote with a special *trigger* word.

Trigger words are case insensitive, and must be one of the following:

| Type | Trigger |
| -----|-------- |
| Danger  | `danger`, `attention` |
| Warning | `warning`, `notice` |
| Info    | `info`, `note` |
| Hint    | `hint`, `tip` |
