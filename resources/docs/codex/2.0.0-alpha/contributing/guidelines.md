Contributing Guidelines
=======================

Create an Issue
---------------
If you find a bug in Codex (and you don't know how to fix it), have trouble following the documentation, or have a question about Codex - create an issue! There's nothing to it and whatever issue you're having, you're likely not the only one, so others will find your issue helpful, too. For more information on how GitHub issues work, check out [GitHub's issues guide](http://guides.github.com/features/issues).

> **Issues Pro Tips**
> - **Check existing issues** for your issue. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you're running into has been addressed already.
> - **Be clear** about what your problem is: what was the expected outcome and what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
> - **Link to examples** recreating (or showing) the issue if you have Codex installed on a server.
> - **Include system details** like what the browser and operating system you're using and its version.
> - **Paste error output** or logs in your issue or in a [Gist](http://gist.github.com/). If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks: ` ``` ` so that it renders nicely.

Pull Request
------------
If you’re able to patch the bug or add the feature yourself – fantastic, make a pull request with the code! Be sure you’ve read through the contribution guidelines here and understand the MIT license. Once you’ve submitted a pull request I can compare your branch to the master one and decide whether or not to incorporate (pull in) your changes.

> **Pull Require Pro Tips**
> - **[Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) the repository** and clone it locally. Connect your local to the original 'upstream' repository by adding it as a remote. **Pull in changes** from 'upstream' often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely. See more detailed instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/).
> - **Create a [branch](http://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)** for your edits.
> - **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.
> - **Include screenshots** of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
> - **Contribute code in PSR-1 and PSR-2** to the best of your abilities. It makes it easier for me to merge as well for others to understand and maintain in the future.

If your pull request is merged – great! If it is not, no sweat, it may not be what I had in mind for Codex, or I was already working on it. This happens, so my recommendation is to take any feedback you’ve received and go forth and pull request again – or create your own open source project.
